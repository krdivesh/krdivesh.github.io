## The RAR Challenge on macOS

Ever been in that situation where someone sends you a RAR file and your Mac just stares at you blankly?

Happened to me last week when I downloaded something off the internet but alas I had to go on an adventure before I could actually use that.

Unlike our Windows friends who have WinRAR at their fingertips, we Mac users are left to fend for ourselves when it comes to this.

After a bit of googling, I found a clean and efficient solution. So let me save you the trouble!! 


### üç∫ Step 1: Install RAR via Homebrew

```bash
brew install rar
```

If you don't have Homebrew installed what man I thought you were cool  use the below command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### üì¶ Step 2: Extract the RAR File

Navigate to your file location and run:

```bash
rar x filename.rar
```

This will extract all contents to the current directory.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: "This software needs to be updated"

If you encounter this security message:

```
This software needs to be updated. Contact the developer for more information.
```

Here's the quick fix:

#### üîç Step 1: Locate the RAR Executable

```bash
which rar
```

#### üîì Step 2: Remove the Quarantine Flag

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path_to_rar>
```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 3: Try Again

Run the extraction command again and it should work.

### Ô∏èCreating Your Own RAR Archives
Now what good is having the power to just extract a rar file. When you can't flex it by archiving stuff yourself?

```bash
rar a archive.rar myfile.txt
```

### üîí Create a Password-Protected Archive

```bash
rar a -p archive.rar myfiles/
```
You'll be prompted to enter and confirm a password.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Create Split Archives

Useful for sharing large files:

```bash
rar a -v10m archive.rar largefiles/
```

This creates 10MB chunks that can be easily shared.
